This is a small program which contains parts from DOSBox sources which
enables it to act as a IPXNET server where DOSBox(es) can connect to.
Besides being a dedicated server it also mirrors the IPX packets between
a real physical ethernet network where real DOS computers can be
connected to. This allows playing IPX games between real computers on
one end and DOSBox emulators at another end.

Command line help is self-explaining and copyright texts are in ipxgw.cpp.

I was lazy and new so config.h has some hard values from AMD64 Linux system,
which should suffice for most users. This has no autoconf - just run make.
You need to have SDL 1.2, SDL_net and libpcap libraries with headers 
installed besides g++ and standard C headers.

This is untested with combination of multiple real DOS computers, but it
works with at least one. Problem might also be if you use a switch and not
a simple old hub with those multiple computers because some packets might
not be visible to the gateway and therefore not sent to DOSBox(es).

You might ask, why do this? Well, there exists NE2000 driver for DOSBox
but that does not work over the Internet - it allows only a local DOS 
computer to talk with a local DOSBox. This is the only way to allow
remote DOSBox people to connect with your real DOS computer to play IPX
games, as long as you can run the server.

The code could be improved a lot as it was just quickly hacked together
and then made to work with help of some wireshark debugging. Feel free
to improve it as the license allows. My e-mail is salinjus@gmail.com.
